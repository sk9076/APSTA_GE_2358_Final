## Overview of the project 

### Background
One of the critical approaches to reduce the burden of infectious diseases is preventive measures informed by early warning signals [1-4]. However, the complex transmission dynamics of many such diseases result in ineffective and inefficient control programs [5-7]. The importance of predictive early warning systems (EWS) that provide longer lead times for strategic planning and implementation of dengue control activities has been propounded, yet few countries have operationalized EWSs for preparedness and response. The main issue from the decision-maker’s point of view is that public health response triggered by an EWS needs to be not only effective but also show economic viability in the face of uncertainty in disease forecasts. If the economic evaluation of potential response activities can be coupled with a disease forecasting model, this framework can simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness and economic value of public health responses triggered at different lead times. When the model tailored to a specific local context, this hybrid framework has the potential to recommend pragmatic vector control targets and interventions and quantify the economic risk associated with acting upon imperfect early warning signals to inform decision-making.

### Objective: 
To build a Shiny application that can inform the infectious disease control program officers on their intervention effectiveness before executing it. 

### Key features of the application:
* 1) Let the users choose the infectious disease of their interest (we can start with 2-3 diseases with simple transmission dynamics, or even 1 if it’s too much burden)
* 2) Tweak the transmission-related parameters (i.e. incubation period, effective contact rate, initial vaccination rate in the population, etc)
* 3) Choose the intervention (i.e. social distancing, vaccination, medical treatment)
* 4) Simulate the averted disease burden (i.e. # of cases and/or healthcare cost averted) in simple deterministic model (point estimate with no 95% CI)
